Story of the world:
    Welcome to Pleiades, an immersive MMORPG set in a magical medieval world teetering on the brink of chaos. As a player, you embark on a heroic journey to save the realm from impending doom by selecting one of three iconic classes: Warrior, Mage, or Archer.

    In Pleiades, you'll explore vast, enchanting landscapes, encountering mythical creatures, ancient ruins, and bustling medieval towns. Choose your path wisely as you develop unique skills and abilities tailored to your chosen class, each offering distinct advantages in the battle against the forces of darkness.

    The central quest revolves around the ultimate goal of defeating the menacing Demon King, whose dark influence threatens to consume the entire world. Along your journey, forge alliances with fellow players, engage in epic battles, and uncover hidden secrets that could tip the scales in your favor.

    Pleiades boasts a rich narrative, dynamic gameplay, and visually stunning graphics that bring the magic of the medieval world to life. Will you rise to the challenge, master your chosen class, and become the savior of Pleiades? The fate of the realm rests in your hands.
